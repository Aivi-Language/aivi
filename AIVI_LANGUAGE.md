## 1 Core Design

- Statically typed, purely functional, expression-oriented.
- Immutable bindings; **no mutation**, no loops, no null.
- Use `Option A` / `Result E A` instead of null; `Validation E A` for error accumulation; recursion, folds, or generators instead of loops.
- Pattern bindings with `=` must be **total**; refutable matches use `match`.
- Records are structural and closed (no row polymorphism).
- Effects are explicit: `Effect E A` (error type `E`, success type `A`).
- Domains give meaning to operators and suffix literals for non-`Int` types.
- No semicolons — bindings and block statements are separated by newlines.
- Opening `{` always on the same line as the keyword (`do Effect {`, `generate {`, `x match`).
- Avoid deeply nested expressions — extract inner logic into named helper functions.

## 2 Lexical Basics

| Element                                   | Syntax                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:----------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Line comment                              | `//` to end of line                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Block comment                             | `/* ... */` — may span multiple lines; **does not nest**                                                                                                                               |
| Value / function / field names            | `lowerCamelCase` (`lowerIdent`)                                                                                                                                                        |
| Type / constructor / domain / class names | `UpperCamelCase` (`UpperIdent`)                                                                                                                                                        |
| Module path segments / `.aivi` file names | `snake_case` (for example `myapp.daemon.command_queue` -> `myapp/daemon/command_queue.aivi`)                                                                                           |
| Text literal                              | `"hello { name }"` (interpolation with `{ expr }`)                                                                                                                                     |
| Int, Float                                | `42`, `3.14`                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Char                                      | `'a'`                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Suffixed number                           | `10px`, `30s`, `100%` (domain-resolved)                                                                                                                                                |
| Keywords                                  | `as class do domain effect else export generate given hiding if in instance machine match mock module on opaque or over patch recurse resource snapshot then unless use when with yield loop` |

`True`, `False`, `None`, `Some`, `Ok`, `Err` are constructors, not keywords.

`effect { }` is a **deprecated** alias for `do Effect { }` (emits warning W1600); always write `do Effect { }`.
`@` in patterns is **deprecated** in favour of `as` (emits warning W1603); write `name as pattern` instead of `name@pattern`.

---

## 3 Bindings and Scope

All bindings use `=`. There is no `let`, `var`, or `const`.

```aivi
x = 42
add = a b => a + b
```

### Destructuring

```aivi
{ name, age } = user             // record destructuring
(a, b) = pair                    // tuple destructuring
[h, ...t] = list                 // list head/tail (must be total)
user as { name } = getUser       // whole-value + destructure
```

### Record pattern operators

| Syntax                 | `field` in scope? | Inner bindings? | Purpose                         |
|:---------------------- |:-----------------:|:---------------:|:------------------------------- |
| `{ field: pat }`       | no (renamed)      | yes             | Match / rename a field          |
| `{ field as { pat } }` | yes               | yes             | Keep whole field + destructure  |
| `{ field.{ pat } }`    | no                | yes             | Destructure only, discard field |
| `{ field }`            | yes               | -               | Shorthand, binds field by name  |

Deep path destructuring: `{ data.user.profile.name }` reaches nested fields directly.

### Shadowing

Shadowing is allowed. It introduces a new binding; there is no mutation.

```aivi
x = 1
x = x + 1  // new binding, old `x` is no longer accessible
```

### Recursion

Top-level module bindings are recursive (can refer to themselves and later bindings). Local recursion uses module-level helpers or generators with `loop`/`recurse`.

---

## 4 Functions

### Definition and application

Functions are **curried**. Application is by whitespace.

```aivi
add : Int -> Int -> Int
add = a b => a + b

result = add 5 10       // 15
inc = add 1             // partial application
```

### Lambdas

```aivi
x => x + 1              // explicit lambda
_ + 1                   // placeholder lambda (unary only)
a b => a + b            // multi-argument
```

`_` in expression position is a single-argument placeholder lambda. It is only valid where a unary function is expected.

### Pipes (`|>`)

Pipes apply the value on the left as the **last** argument to the right-hand side.

```aivi
xs |> map inc |> filter (_ > 0)
```

Rules: `x |> f` = `f x`; `x |> f a b` = `f a b x`.

### Multi-clause functions

A unary function can be written as multiple match arms directly:

```aivi
describe =
  | 0 => "zero"
  | 1 => "one"
  | _ => "many"
```

Multi-clause definitions require an explicit type signature for that function name.
With closed records, this keeps each clause checked against the exact input record shape.
If no clause matches at runtime, evaluation fails with a non-exhaustive-match runtime error.

For multi-argument matching, match on a tuple:

```aivi
gcd = (a, b) => (a, b) match
  | (x, 0) => x
  | (x, y) => gcd y (x % y)
```

### Accessor sugar

`.field` (with dot prefix) is shorthand for `x => x.field`:

```aivi
users |> map name // or map _.name
```

---

## 5 Pattern Matching (`match`)

`match` takes the expression **immediately to its left** and tests it against arms.

```aivi
value match
  | Ok x  => x
  | Err _ => 0
```

Works with pipelines:

```aivi
input |> parse |> validate match
  | Ok x  => x
  | Err e => handle e
```

### Guards

```aivi
classify = n => n match
  | _ when n > 0 => "positive"
  | _ when n < 0 => "negative"
  | _            => "zero"
```

### Whole-value binding in patterns

```aivi
response match
  | { data.user.profile as { name } }  => name
  | { data.guest: True }               => "Guest"
  | _                                  => "Unknown"
```

### Nested constructor patterns

```aivi
parse = expr => expr match
  | Add (Lit a) (Lit b) => Lit (a + b)
  | _                   => expr
```

### Exhaustiveness

All `match` expressions must be exhaustive. Non-exhaustive matches are compile errors. Use `_` as a catch-all.

---

## 6 Types

### Compiler primitives

```aivi
Unit  Bool  Int  Float
```

### Standard library types

```aivi
Text  Bytes  Decimal  BigInt
Duration  Instant  Date  Time  TimeZone  ZonedDateTime
```

### Algebraic data types (ADTs)

```aivi
Option A = None | Some A
Result E A = Err E | Ok A
Validation E A = Valid A | Invalid E
Color = Red | Green | Blue
Tree A = Leaf A | Node (Tree A) (Tree A)
```

Create values by applying constructors: `Some 42`, `Err "nope"`, `Valid "ok"`, `Node (Leaf 1) (Leaf 2)`.
Nullary constructors (`None`, `True`, `Red`) are values directly.
Use `constructorName value` and `constructorOrdinal value` to inspect an ADT value at runtime.
`constructorOrdinal` is zero-based by constructor declaration order.

### Branded nominal types

```aivi
Email = Text!

mkEmail : Text -> Email
mkEmail = text => Email text
```

`T = U!` creates a nominal type `T` (distinct from `U`) using a single constructor named `T`.
Instances for the base type are auto-forwarded to the branded type when available; explicit
instances for the branded type take precedence.

### Opaque types

```aivi
opaque Url = {
  protocol: Text, host: Text, port: Option Int,
  path: Text, query: List (Text, Text), hash: Option Text
}
```

The `opaque` keyword hides the type's internal structure outside its defining module:
- **Inside the module**: fully transparent — construct, access fields, pattern match, update freely.
- **Outside the module**: opaque — no record literals, no field access, no `<|` update, no structural pattern matching.
- Domain operators and exported functions still work from outside.
- Works for records, ADTs (`opaque Color = Red | Green | Blue`), branded types, and plain aliases.

### Closed records

```aivi
User = { id: Int, name: Text, email: Option Text }

// Functions require the exact record shape:
greet : User -> Text
greet = user => "Hello, { user.name }"
```

### Record creation and spread

```aivi
p = { x: 1, y: 2 }
q = { ...p, x: 3 }          // later fields win: { x: 3, y: 2 }
```

### Tuples and lists

```aivi
pair = (1, "hello")
xs = [1, 2, 3]
ys = [0, ...xs, 4]          // spread
zs = [1 .. 10]              // range (inclusive)
```

### Row transforms (type-level)

```aivi
Pick (id, name) User
Omit (isAdmin) User
Optional (email) User
Required (email) User
Rename { createdAt: created_at } User
Defaulted (email) User   // like Optional at type level; used for codec/default derivation

// Type-level pipe:
User |> Pick (id, name) |> Optional (name)
```

### Type signatures

```aivi
add : Int -> Int -> Int
```

Type signatures are also required for multi-clause function definitions (`f = | ... => ...`).

### Classes and instances (ad-hoc polymorphism, HKTs)

```aivi
class Setoid A = {
  equals: A -> A -> Bool
}

class Ord A = Setoid {
  lte: A -> A -> Bool
}

class Semigroup A = {
  concat: A -> A -> A
}

class Monoid A = Semigroup {
  empty: A
}

class Functor (F A) = {
  map: (A -> B) -> F B
}

class Apply (F A) = Functor {
  ap: F (A -> B) -> F B
}

class Applicative (F A) = Apply {
  of: A -> F A
}

class Chain (F A) = Apply {
  chain: (A -> F B) -> F B
}

class Monad (M A) = Applicative, Chain {}

class Foldable (F A) = {
  reduce: (B -> A -> B) -> B -> B
}

class Traversable (T A) = Functor, Foldable {
  traverse: (A -> F B) -> F (T B)
}

class Filterable (F A) = Functor {
  filter: (A -> Bool) -> F A
}

class Alternative (F A) = Applicative {
  alt: F A -> F A
}

class Plus (F A) = Alternative {
  zero: F A
}

class Bifunctor (F A B) = {
  bimap: (A -> C) -> (B -> D) -> F C D
}

instance Monad (Option A) = { ... }
instance Monad (Result E A) = { ... }
instance Monad (List A) = { ... }
instance Semigroup Text = { ... }
instance Monoid Text = { ... }
```

Type variables in class/instance declarations are implicitly universally quantified.
Use `given (A: ClassName)` only when a real constraint is needed (e.g., `given (A: Eq)`).
HKT class member signatures use **abbreviated form**: the container type is omitted and
added internally by the compiler as the last argument.

All class methods from `aivi.logic` support both direct application and pipe syntax:
`map f xs` and `xs |> map f` are equivalent. `use aivi.logic` brings all class methods
into scope.

**Bidirectional resolution of zero-argument members**: Class members that are values
(e.g. `empty` from `Monoid`) resolve via expected type from context — a type annotation
or function signature is enough. When ambiguous, use qualified forms: `List.empty`,
`Map.empty`.

### Type class instance table

| Type | Setoid | Ord | Semigroup | Monoid | Functor | Filterable | Foldable | Traversable | Apply | Applicative | Chain | Monad | Bifunctor | Alternative | Plus |
|------|:------:|:---:|:---------:|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----------:|:----:|
| `List A` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `Option A` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `Result E A` | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `Map K V` | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `Generator A` | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `Tree A` | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| `Stream A` | — | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

### Type variable constraints

```aivi
class Collection (C A) = given (A: Eq) {
  elem : A -> C A -> Bool
  unique : C A -> C A
}
```

### Expected-type coercions

In positions where a `Text` is expected, the compiler may insert `toText expr` if a `ToText A` instance is in scope.

When the expected type is `Body` (from `aivi.net.http`), the compiler coerces:

- Record literal → `Json (toJson record)`
- `Text` → `Plain text`
- `JsonValue` → `Json jv`

When the expected type is `Option A` and the expression does not match, the compiler tries to coerce to `A` and wraps in `Some`. These coercions chain, so a bare record in an `Option Body` position becomes `Some (Json (toJson { ... }))`:

```aivi
body: { grant_type: "authorization_code", code: code }
// elaborated to: Some (Json (toJson { grant_type: ..., code: ... }))
```

`toJson : A -> JsonValue` is a structural built-in that converts any value — records, lists, primitives, `Option` — to a `JsonValue`. The `Json` body variant also auto-injects `Content-Type: application/json`.

---

## 7 Predicates

Predicate expressions are `Bool` expressions that can be used directly where a function `A -> Bool` is expected (auto-lifted).

```aivi
users |> filter active               // active is _.active
users |> filter (age > 18)           // age is _.age
users |> find (email == Some "x")
xs |> takeWhile (_ < 10)
```

Inside predicates:

- `_` is the current element.
- Bare field names resolve to `_.field`.
- `.field` is an accessor function, not a field value.
- Combinators: `!p`, `p && q`, `p || q`.
- Pattern predicates: `Some _`, `Ok { value } when value > 10`.

---

## 8 Patching (Structural Updates)

`<|` applies a declarative, type-checked patch to a record.

```aivi
user2 = user <| { name: "Sam" }
user3 = user <| { profile.avatar: "new.png" }
```

### Path addressing

```aivi
record <| { a.b.c: value }                // dot paths
record <| { items[*].price: _ * 1.1 }     // traversal (all items)
record <| { items[price > 80].tag: "hot" } // predicate selector
record <| { lookup["key"]: newVal }        // map key selector
```

### Instructions

| Instruction   | Meaning                                         |
|:------------- |:----------------------------------------------- |
| `value`       | Replace or insert                               |
| `function`    | Transform existing value (applied to old value) |
| `:= function` | Replace with function **as data** (not applied) |
| `-`           | Remove field (shrinks record type)              |

### Patch-as-value

```aivi
p = patch { name: toUpper }     // Patch User, i.e. User -> User
result = user <| p
```

---

## 9 Blocks

AIVI has five block forms, each introduced by a keyword and delimited with `{ ... }`: `generate`, `do M`, `resource`, `machine`, and plain `{ ... }` (pure computation). The first four are described below; `resource` is covered in §11.

### `generate { ... }` - Pure sequences

Pull-based, lazy sequences. No effects, no suspension.

```aivi
gen = generate {
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3
}
```

**Bindings, guards, transforms:**

```aivi
evens = generate {
  x <- [1 .. 100]
  x -> x % 2 == 0           // guard (filter)
  yield x
}
```

**Cartesian product:**

```aivi
pairs = generate {
  x <- [1 .. 3]
  y <- ["a", "b"]
  yield (x, y)
}
```

**Tail-recursive loops:**

```aivi
fibs = generate {
  loop (a, b) = (0, 1) => {
    yield a
    recurse (b, a + b)
  }
}
```

Summary of statements inside `generate { ... }`:

- `x <- source` - bind from another generator/list
- `x = expr` - pure local binding
- `x -> pred` - guard (filter by predicate)
- `yield expr` - emit a value
- `loop pat = init => { ... recurse next }` - local tail recursion

### `do Effect { ... }` - Effectful computation

The most common block form. Sequences effectful operations with typed errors.

```aivi
main = do Effect {
  cfg  <- load (file.read "config.json")   // <- runs effect
  name = cfg.appName                        // = is pure binding
  print "loaded { name }"
}
```

Statements inside `do Effect { ... }`:

- `x <- eff` - run effect, bind result
- `_ <- eff` - run effect and intentionally discard result (optional; use when value is unused)
- `x = expr` - pure local binding (`expr` must NOT be `Effect`)
- `x <- resource` - acquire a `Resource`, released on scope exit
- `when cond <- eff` - conditional (runs `eff` only when `cond` is true)
- `unless cond <- eff` - negated conditional (runs `eff` only when `cond` is false)
- `given cond or failExpr` - precondition guard
- Final expression must be `Effect E A` (commonly `pure value`)
- Statement expressions must be `Effect E Unit`; non-Unit results must be bound

**Tail-recursive loops in effect blocks:**

`loop`/`recurse` works inside `do Effect { ... }` blocks for stateful iteration:

```aivi
dijkstra = source graph => do Effect {
  dists0 = empty |> insert source 0.0

  loop state = { dists: dists0, pq: Heap.push (0.0, source) Heap.empty } => {
    dists = state.dists
    pq = state.pq
    result = Heap.popMin pq
    result match
      | None                       => pure dists
      | Some ((d, node), restPq)   => do Effect {
          currentDist = dists |> getOrElse node 999999.0
          if d > currentDist
            then do Effect { recurse { dists: dists, pq: restPq } }
            else do Effect {
              edges = edgesFrom graph node
              nextState <- processEdges dists d edges restPq
              recurse nextState
          }
        }
  }
}
```

- `loop pat = init => { body }` - local tail-recursive loop (same syntax as in generators)
- `recurse newState` - continue with the next iteration
- Omitting `recurse` in a branch terminates the loop
- The loop body `{ ... }` is promoted to the parent effect-block kind, so `<-`, `when`/`unless`, and `recurse` work inside

**Event wiring (`on`):**

Inside `do Effect { ... }`, `on Event => handler` wires event handlers for state machine transitions or UI events:

```aivi
main = do Effect {
  on Click => do Effect {
    count <- getState
    setState (count + 1)
  }
  on KeyPress => handleKey
}
```

### `do M { ... }` - General monadic blocks

`do Monad { ... }` is the general form; `do Effect { ... }` is the most common specialisation. `Option` and `Result` are also supported:

```aivi
// do Option: short-circuits on None
safeLookup = key1 key2 map => do Option {
  x <- map |> get key1
  y <- map |> get key2
  Some (x + y)
}

// do Result: short-circuits on Err
validateAge = input => do Result {
  n <- parseInt input
  ok <- if n >= 0 && n <= 150 then Ok n else Err "out of range"
  Ok ok
}
```

The same bind (`<-`) and pure-bind (`=`) syntax applies. Statement availability by block kind:

| Statement                   | `do Effect` | `do M` (generic) | `generate`        |
|:--------------------------- |:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| `x <- expr`                 | ✓           | ✓                | ✓ (from sequence) |
| `x = expr`                  | ✓           | ✓                | ✓                 |
| `expr` (sequencing)         | ✓           | ✓                | —                 |
| `yield expr`                | —           | —                | ✓                 |
| `x -> pred` (guard)         | —           | —                | ✓                 |
| `or` fallback               | ✓           | —                | —                 |
| `when`/`unless cond <- eff` | ✓           | —                | —                 |
| `given cond or expr`        | ✓           | —                | —                 |
| `on Event => handler`       | ✓           | —                | —                 |
| `loop`/`recurse`            | ✓           | —                | ✓                 |
| resource `<-`               | ✓           | —                | —                 |

Effect-specific statements (`or`, `when`, `unless`, `given`, `on`, resource `<-`, `loop`/`recurse`) are **only** available in `do Effect` blocks.

### `machine { ... }` - State machines

`machine` declares a state machine where transitions are first-class and states are inferred.

```aivi
machine Door = {
           -> Closed : init   {}
  Closed   -> Opened : open   {}
  Opened   -> Closed : close  {}
  Opened   -> Locked : lock   {}
  Locked   -> Closed : unlock {}
}
```

`-> State : init {}` marks the starting state. `Source -> Target : event { payload }` defines transitions with optional typed payloads. States are inferred from the transition graph. The compiler checks completeness and type safety.

Runtime machine values are available by machine name and can be destructured as records:

```aivi
do Effect {
  { lease, run, done, currentState, can } = AccountSyncMachine
  _ <- assertEq (constructorName (currentState Unit)) "Idle"
  _ <- lease {}
  _ <- run { batchId: 42 }
  _ <- done {}
}
```

`can.<transition> Unit` reports if the transition is valid from the current state.
Invalid transition calls fail with `InvalidTransition { machine, from, event, expectedFrom }`.
`on transition => handler` handlers run after a successful state transition applies.

---

## 10 Effects

`Effect E A` models typed effects where `E` is the error type and `A` is the success type.

### Core operations

| Operation | Type                                            | Purpose                 |
|:--------- |:----------------------------------------------- |:----------------------- |
| `pure`    | `A -> Effect E A`                               | Lift a value            |
| `fail`    | `E -> Effect E A`                               | Abort with error        |
| `bind`    | `Effect E A -> (A -> Effect E B) -> Effect E B` | Sequence                |
| `attempt` | `Effect E A -> Effect F (Result E A)`           | Catch error as `Result` |

### Error fallback with `or`

```aivi
// Effect fallback (inside do Effect block after <-):
txt <- load (file.read path) or "(missing)"

// With error pattern matching:
val <- riskyOp or
  | NotFound msg => pure default
  | Timeout _    => fail "timed out"

// Result fallback (expression form):
count = result or 0
```

`or` arms match the **error value** directly (write `NotFound m`, not `Err NotFound m`).

### Attempt (error recovery)

```aivi
getUser = id => do Effect {
  res <- attempt (api.fetchUser id)
  res match
    | Ok user => pure user
    | Err _   => pure GuestUser
}
```

`attempt` catches errors of type `E`, producing `Result E A`. The outer effect has error type `F` (different from `E`).

### Conditional effects (`when`)

`when cond <- eff` runs `eff` only when `cond` is true. Otherwise the block continues with `Unit`.

```aivi
main = do Effect {
  cfg <- loadConfig
  when cfg.verbose <- print "verbose mode enabled"
  when cfg.dryRun <- print "dry run, no side effects"
  process cfg
}
```

Desugars to: `_ <- if cond then eff else pure Unit`.

### Negated conditional effects (`unless`)

`unless cond <- eff` runs `eff` only when `cond` is **false**. It is the exact negation of `when`.

```aivi
main = do Effect {
  cfg <- loadConfig
  unless cfg.skipSetup <- runSetup cfg
  unless cfg.quiet     <- print "done"
  process cfg
}
```

Desugars to: `_ <- if cond then pure Unit else eff`.

### Precondition guards (`given`)

`given cond or failExpr` asserts a condition. If `cond` is false, `failExpr` is evaluated (typically `fail`).

```aivi
withdraw = amount account => do Effect {
  given amount > 0 or fail (InvalidAmount amount)
  given account.balance >= amount or fail InsufficientFunds
  updateBalance account (account.balance - amount)
}
```

`given` also supports match arms on the condition's value:

```aivi
main = do Effect {
  given validate input or
    | InvalidField f => fail (BadRequest f)
    | MissingField f => fail (BadRequest "missing: { f }")
  process input
}
```

Desugars to: `_ <- if cond then pure Unit else failExpr`.

### Branching in effect blocks

`if`/`then`/`else` is an expression. For multi-step branches, use nested `do Effect { ... }`:

```aivi
process = input => do Effect {
  validated <- validate input
  result <- if validated.needsReview then
    do Effect {
      _ <- notifyReviewer validated
      pure (Pending validated)
    }
  else pure (Approved validated)
  pure result
}
```

## 11 Resources

`Resource E A` - a recipe for acquiring a handle of type `A` (with error type `E`), using it, and releasing it.

### Defining

```aivi
managedFile = path => resource {
  handle <- file.open path       // acquire
  yield handle                   // provide to caller
  file.close handle              // release (runs on scope exit)
}
```

Rules: exactly one `yield`; code after `yield` is cleanup; cleanup may perform effects.

### Using

```aivi
main = do Effect {
  f <- managedFile "data.txt"       // acquired here
  content <- file.readAll f
  print content
}                                    // f released here (LIFO)
```

Multiple resources are released in reverse acquisition order. Cleanup runs even on error or cancellation.

---

## 12 Modules and Imports

One module per file. `module` must be the first non-empty item.

```aivi
module my.app.api
export fetchUser, User

use aivi.net.http (get)
use aivi.json (decode)

User = { id: Int, name: Text }

fetchUser : Int -> Effect HttpError User
fetchUser = id => do Effect {
  resp <- get (~u(https://api.example.com/users/{ id }))
  decode resp.body
}
```

### Import forms

```aivi
use aivi.text                            // import all public symbols
use aivi.text (toUpper, toLower)         // selective
use aivi.text hiding (trim)             // import all except
use aivi.text as T                       // aliased module
use aivi.chronos.duration (domain Duration)  // import domain
```

### Export forms

```aivi
export add, subtract, pi                 // selective
export domain Color                      // export domain
export add = a b => a + b                // inline exported binding
export machine Flow = {                  // inline exported declaration
  -> Idle : boot {}
}
```

### Prelude

Every module implicitly does `use aivi.prelude`. Disable with `@no_prelude`.

### Module path convention

- `vendor.name.*` - third-party libraries
- `user.app.*` - application code
- In application code, module path segments and backing file names should be `snake_case`.

**Core & Utils** (`aivi.*`):
`prelude` (implicit), `text`, `logic`, `units`, `regex`, `testing`, `collections` (re-exports `list`, `map`, `set`, `queue`, `heap`), `i18n`, `generator`, `json`, `defaults`

**Math & Science** (`aivi.*`):
`math`, `vector`, `matrix`, `number`, `geometry`, `graph`, `linear_algebra`, `tree`

**Time** (`aivi.chronos.*`):
`instant`, `calendar`, `duration`, `timezone`, `scheduler`

**System** (`aivi.*`):
`system`, `concurrency`, `crypto`, `secrets`, `log`

**IO** (`aivi.*`):
`file`, `console`, `database`, `database.pool`, `email`, `path`, `url`, `rest`

**Network** (`aivi.net.*`):
`http`, `https`, `httpServer`, `sockets`, `streams`

**UI** (`aivi.ui.*` and `aivi.*`):
`ui.gtk4`, `ui.layout`, `color`

---

## 13 External Sources

`Source K A` represents typed external data. Load with `load` inside `do Effect { ... }`.

```aivi
cfg <- load (file.read "config.json")
cfgTyped <- load (file.json "config.json")
rows <- load (file.csv "users.csv")
resp <- load (rest.get ~u(https://api.example.com/data))
apiKey <- load (env.get "API_KEY")
appCfg <- load (env.decode "AIVI_APP")
```

Available source APIs in v0.1: `file.read/json/csv/imageMeta/image`, `http`/`https`, `rest`, `env.get/decode`, `email.imap`.

### Email Module (`aivi.email`)

**Auth**: `EmailAuth = Password Text | OAuth2 Text` — supports XOAUTH2 for Gmail/Outlook.

**One-shot**: `imap : ImapConfig -> Effect Text (List A)` — connect, fetch, disconnect.
**SMTP**: `smtpSend : SmtpConfig -> Effect Text Unit` — multi-recipient with CC/BCC.
**MIME**: `mimeParts : Text -> List MimePart`, `flattenBodies : List MimePart -> Text`.

**Session API** (persistent connection via `Resource`):
```
imapOpen      : ImapConfig -> Resource Text ImapSession
imapSelect    : Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text MailboxInfo
imapExamine   : Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text MailboxInfo
imapSearch    : Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text (List Int)
imapFetch     : List Int -> ImapSession -> Effect Text (List A)
imapSetFlags  : List Int -> List Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapAddFlags  : List Int -> List Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapRemoveFlags : List Int -> List Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapExpunge   : ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapCopy      : List Int -> Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapMove      : List Int -> Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapListMailboxes   : ImapSession -> Effect Text (List MailboxInfo)
imapCreateMailbox   : Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapDeleteMailbox   : Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapRenameMailbox   : Text -> Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapAppend    : Text -> Text -> ImapSession -> Effect Text Unit
imapIdle      : Int -> ImapSession -> Effect Text IdleResult
```

Types: `MailboxInfo = { name: Text, separator: Option Text, attributes: List Text }`, `IdleResult = TimedOut | MailboxChanged`.

`@static` embeds sources at compile time: `@static schema = file.json "schema.json"` or `@static envName = env.get "AIVI_BUILD_ENV"`.

`@static` can also generate typed, callable API clients from OpenAPI specs:

```aivi
@static
petStoreApi = openapi.fromUrl ~url(https://petstore.example.com/v2/swagger.json)

@static
internalApi = openapi.fromFile "./specs/api.yaml"
```

The result is a factory function: pass a config record to get callable endpoint functions.

```aivi
client = petStoreApi { bearerToken: Some "sk-...", baseUrl: None, headers: None, timeoutMs: None, retryCount: None, strictStatus: None }
pets <- client.listPets { limit: Some 10 }

// Destructuring works too
{ listPets } = petStoreApi { bearerToken: None, baseUrl: None, headers: None, timeoutMs: None, retryCount: None, strictStatus: None }
result <- listPets {}
```

Config fields: `bearerToken : Option Text`, `headers : Option (List (Text, Text))`, `timeoutMs : Option Int`, `retryCount : Option Int`, `strictStatus : Option Bool`, `baseUrl : Option Text`.

## 14 Sigils

Custom literals with `~tag` and a delimiter:

```aivi
~u(https://example.com)        // URL
~path[/usr/local/bin]          // Path
~r/[a-z]+/i                    // Regex
~map{ "a" => 1, "b" => 2 }    // Map K V literal
~set[1, 2, 3]                  // Set A literal
~mat[1.0 0.0                   // Matrix literal (Mat2/Mat3/Mat4)
     0.0 1.0]
~d(2024-05-21)                 // Date
~t(12:00:00)                   // Time
~tz(Europe/Paris)              // TimeZone
~k"app.button.save"            // i18n key (validated at parse time)
~m"Hello, {name}!"             // i18n message template (validated at parse time)
~`raw text, no interpolation`  // Raw Text — multiline, no { } interpolation
~<html><div>{ "x" }</div></html> // Typed VDOM node
~<gtk><object class="GtkBox" /></gtk> // Typed GTK builder node
~<gtk><GtkBox spacing="24" /></gtk> // Shorthand widget syntax
```

`~map{...}`, `~set[...]`, `~mat[...]`, `~<html>...</html>`, and `~<gtk>...</gtk>` are **structured** (parsed as AIVI expressions). Other sigils are raw text until the closing delimiter.

The backtick sigil `` ~`...` `` produces a `Text` value with the verbatim content between the backticks. It supports multiple lines and no `{ }` interpolation occurs:

```aivi
json   = ~`{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}`
query  = ~`SELECT *
           FROM users
           WHERE id = 1`
```

GTK sigils support **widget shorthand**: tags starting with `Gtk`, `Adw`, or `Gsk` are sugar for `<object class="...">` where attributes become props automatically:

```aivi
// Shorthand (preferred)
~<gtk>
  <GtkBox spacing="24" marginTop="12">
    <GtkLabel label="Hello" />
    <GtkButton label="Save" onClick={ Msg.Save } />
  </GtkBox>
</gtk>

// Equivalent verbose form
~<gtk>
  <object class="GtkBox" props={{ spacing: 24, marginTop: 12 }}>
    <object class="GtkLabel" props={{ label: "Hello" }} />
    <object class="GtkButton" props={{ label: "Save" }} onClick={ Msg.Save } />
  </object>
</gtk>
```

GTK sigils also support signal sugar in v0.1:

```aivi
~<gtk>
  <object class="GtkButton" onClick={ Msg.Save } />
  <object class="GtkEntry" onInput={ Msg.Changed } />
  <object class="GtkEntry" onActivate={ Msg.Submit } />
  <object class="GtkCheckButton" onToggle={ Msg.Toggled } />
  <object class="GtkScale" onValueChanged={ Msg.VolumeChanged } />
  <object class="GtkEntry" onFocusIn={ Msg.Focused } onFocusOut={ Msg.Blurred } />
  <object class="GtkButton">
    <signal name="clicked" on={ Msg.Save } />
  </object>
</gtk>
```

Signal handlers must be compile-time expressions; they lower into typed GTK signal bindings.
Sugar attrs: `onClick`→`clicked`, `onInput`→`changed`, `onActivate`→`activate`, `onToggle`→`toggled`,
`onValueChanged`→`value-changed`, `onFocusIn`→`focus-enter`, `onFocusOut`→`focus-leave`.
Invalid dynamic handlers produce `E1614`.

GTK signals arrive as typed `GtkSignalEvent` constructors (second field is the widget's `id="..."` name, `""` if unset):

```aivi
GtkSignalEvent =
  | GtkClicked       WidgetId Text
  | GtkInputChanged  WidgetId Text Text
  | GtkActivated     WidgetId Text
  | GtkToggled       WidgetId Text Bool
  | GtkValueChanged  WidgetId Text Float
  | GtkKeyPressed    WidgetId Text Text Text
  | GtkFocusIn       WidgetId Text
  | GtkFocusOut      WidgetId Text
  | GtkUnknownSignal WidgetId Text Text Text Text
```

Consume events via `signalStream` (preferred) or `signalPoll`:

```aivi
events <- signalStream {}      // Recv GtkSignalEvent — push-based, no polling loop needed
concurrency.forEach events (event =>
  event match
    | GtkClicked _ _            => handleSave
    | GtkInputChanged _ _ txt   => handleInput txt
    | GtkToggled _ _ active     => handleToggle active
    | _                         => yield {}
)
```

`concurrency.fold` threads state over a channel: `fold : s -> (s -> a -> Effect e s) -> Recv a -> Effect e s`.
`concurrency.forEach` runs an action on each event: `forEach : Recv a -> (a -> Effect e Unit) -> Effect e Unit`.
Both are exported from `aivi.concurrency`.

`buildWithIds` builds a widget tree and returns `{ root: WidgetId, widgets: Map Text WidgetId }` — avoids separate `widgetById` calls.

`reconcileNode : WidgetId -> GtkNode -> Effect GtkError WidgetId` diffs a new node tree against the live widget tree and applies minimal updates. Returns the (possibly new) root `WidgetId`.

`gtkApp` provides an Elm-architecture combinator that encapsulates init, window creation, event loop, and reconciliation:

```aivi
main = gtkApp {
  id:     "com.example.app",
  title:  "My App",
  size:   (800, 600),
  model:  { count: 0 },
  view:   state => ~<gtk>
    <GtkLabel label={ Int.toString state.count } />
  </gtk>,
  toMsg:  event => event match
    | GtkClicked _ _ => Some Increment
    | _              => None,
  update: msg => state => pure (state <| { count: state.count + 1 })
}
```

Dynamic child lists are supported with `<each>`:

```aivi
~<gtk>
  <object class="GtkBox">
    <each items={items} as={item}>
      <object class="GtkLabel"><property name="label">{ item }</property></object>
    </each>
  </object>
</gtk>
```

Component-style tags (uppercase/dotted) use **record-based lowering** in both sigils — attributes become record fields, children become a `children` field. Signal sugar and `props` normalization do not apply to component tags:

```aivi
// HTML component: Ui.Card { title: "Hello", children: [vElement "span" ...] }
~<html><Ui.Card title="Hello"><span>Body</span></Ui.Card></html>

// GTK component: Ui.Row { id: "r1", onClick: Save }
~<gtk><Ui.Row id="r1" onClick={ Save } /></gtk>
```

## 15 Decorators (v0.1)

Compile-time metadata only. No user-defined decorators.

| Decorator                                      | Purpose                                   |
|:---------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| `@test "desc"`                                 | Mark as test case (mandatory description) |
| `@static`                                      | Embed at compile time                     |
| `@native "mod.fn"`                             | Bind typed def to runtime/native path     |
| `@native "crate::path::fn"`                    | Bridge to Rust crate function (AOT only)  |
| `@deprecated`                                  | Emit warning on use                       |
| `@debug` / `@debug(pipes, args, return, time)` | Debug tracing (with `--debug-trace`)      |
| `@no_prelude`                                  | Skip implicit `use aivi.prelude`          |

`@static` supported sources: `file.read/json/csv`, `env.get`, `openapi.fromUrl ~url(...)`, `openapi.fromFile "..."`. OpenAPI sources produce a factory function `Config -> { endpoints... }` where each endpoint is callable.

Unknown decorators are compile errors.
`@native` is only valid on top-level definitions and requires an explicit type signature. No dummy body is needed — the compiler auto-generates the def from the type signature. Runtime natives use `.` paths (`"mod.fn"`); crate natives use `::` paths (`"crate::fn"`) and require `aivi build`.

---

## 16 Mock Expressions (Testing)

`mock ... in` scopes a binding substitution for testing without restructuring production code.

```aivi
mock <qualified.path> = <expr>
in <body>
```

**Deep scoping**: any function called inside `body` that internally uses the mocked binding sees the mock, not the original. This is what makes it useful — no dependency injection needed.

```aivi
use aivi.rest
use aivi.testing

fetchUsers = rest.get ~u(https://api.example.com/users)

@test "mock rest.get"
testFetch =
  mock rest.get = _ => pure [{ id: 1, name: "Ada" }]
  in do Effect {
    users <- fetchUsers   // calls mock transparently
    assertEq (length users) 1
  }
```

**Multiple mocks** stack before `in`:

```aivi
mock rest.get  = _ => pure [{ id: 1, name: "Ada" }]
mock rest.post = _ _ => pure { success: True }
in do Effect { ... }
```

**Nested mocks** re-shadow outer mocks:

```aivi
mock rest.get = _ => pure []
in mock rest.get = _ => pure [{ id: 1, name: "Ada" }]
   in do Effect { ... }   // sees inner mock
```

| Rule                 | Detail                                                                  |
|:-------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only qualified paths | `mock rest.get = ...` ✓ — `mock localFn = ...` ✗ (use `let` for locals) |
| Type-safe            | Mock expression must match the original binding's type                  |
| Scoped               | Mock is only active inside `in <body>` — originals restored after       |
| Composable           | Works in any expression position, not just `@test`                      |

### Snapshot mocks

`mock snapshot <path>` records real responses on first run and replays from `.snap` files:

```aivi
@test "fetch users (snapshot)"
snapshotTest =
  mock snapshot rest.get

| CLI command                    | Behaviour                             |
|:------------------------------ |:------------------------------------- |
| `aivi test`                    | Replay from `.snap` — fail if missing |
| `aivi test --update-snapshots` | Re-record from real calls             |

### Snapshot assertions

`assertSnapshot` compares a value against a stored `.snap` file:

```aivi
assertSnapshot : Text -> A -> Effect Text Unit

@test "user table"
tableTest = do Effect {
  formatted <- pure (formatUserTable users)
  assertSnapshot "user_table" formatted
}
```

## 17 Domains, Units, and Operators

Domains define operator semantics and suffix literals for non-`Int` types.

```aivi
use aivi.chronos.duration (domain Duration)

deadline = { millis: 0 } + 10min     // + resolved by Duration domain
```

### Suffix literals

Suffix literals are numeric literals followed immediately by a suffix identifier. They resolve to domain-defined **template functions** named `1{suffix}`:

```aivi
10min  30s  100px  50%  2w  3d
```

Suffix can also be applied to a parenthesized expression (variable suffix):

```aivi
(x)kg       // desugars to 1kg applied to x; parentheses required, no space before suffix
```

Common suffix → domain mapping:

| Suffix                     | Domain   | Type            |
|:-------------------------- |:-------- |:--------------- |
| `10ms`, `1s`, `5min`, `2h` | Duration | `Duration`      |
| `1d`, `2w`, `3mo`, `1y`    | Calendar | `CalendarDelta` |
| `20deg`, `1.2rad`          | Angle    | `Angle`         |
| `10l`, `5s`, `30h`         | Color    | `ColorDelta`    |

**Collision rule**: if two imported domains define the same suffix (e.g. both define `1m`), the compiler does not disambiguate by carrier. Resolve by importing only one conflicting domain per module, using `hiding`, or using explicit constructors instead.

### Defining domains

A domain declares one **carrier type** and may contain multiple operator entries for the same token (RHS-typed overloads), provided the full `LHS -> RHS -> Result` types are pairwise distinct. The compiler selects among them by matching the inferred RHS type after the LHS carrier is resolved.

```aivi
domain Color over Rgb = {
  Delta = Lightness Int | Hue Int

  (+) : Rgb -> Delta -> Rgb
  (+) = color (Lightness amount) => adjustLightness color amount
  (+) = color (Hue amount) => adjustHue color amount

  1l = Lightness 1     // suffix template: 3l desugars to Lightness 3
  1h = Hue 1
}
```

**`×` convention**: use `×` for structural/transform-style products (matrix × matrix, matrix × vector) and `*` for scalar scaling. This makes the visual intent explicit.

```aivi
domain LinAlg over Mat3 = {
  (×) : Mat3 -> Mat3 -> Mat3     // matrix-matrix product
  (*) : Mat3 -> Float -> Mat3   // scalar scaling
}
```

### Multi-carrier domains

For types that need the same domain semantics at different arities (e.g. `Vec2` and `Vec3`), define the domain once per carrier:

```aivi
domain Vector over Vec2 = { ... }
domain Vector over Vec3 = { ... }
```

### Import/export

```aivi
use aivi.chronos.duration (domain Duration)    // import domain
export domain Color                             // export domain
export domain Color over Rgb = { ... }         // inline exported domain declaration
```

### Built-in vs domain-resolved operators

Domain-resolved (when non-`Int`): `+`, `-`, `*`, `×`, `/`, `%`.
Built-in for `Int`, `Float`, `BigInt`, `Decimal`, and `Text`: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` (lexicographic / Unicode codepoint order for `Text`).
Always built-in: `==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`, `|>`, `<|`, `..`.

**Domains are not implicit casts.** They supply operator semantics and literal templates only. No global coercions are introduced by importing a domain.

## 18 Operator Precedence (lowest to highest)

1. `|>` (pipe)
2. `??` (coalesce Option)
3. `||` (logical or)
4. `&&` (logical and)
5. `==`, `!=` (equality)
6. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` (comparison)
7. `+`, `-`, `++` (add, concat)
8. `*`, `×`, `/`, `%` (multiply)
9. `<|` (patch)

Unary prefix: `!` (not), `-` (negate).

> **Note:** `~` is **not** a unary operator; it is exclusively a sigil prefix (e.g. `~u(...)`, `~r/.../`).
> Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) are not part of AIVI syntax. Use `aivi.bits` instead.
