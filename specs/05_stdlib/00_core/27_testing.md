# Testing Domain

<!-- quick-info: {"kind":"module","name":"aivi.testing"} -->
The `Testing` domain is built right into the language because reliability shouldn't be an afterthought. Instead of hunting for third-party runners or configuring complex suites, you can just write `@test` next to your code. It provides a standard, unified way to define, discover, and run tests, making sure your code does exactly what you think it does (and keeps doing it after you refactor).
